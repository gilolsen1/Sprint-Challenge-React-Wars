1.  What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve?
React is a UI library that allows developers to dictate what the state should based on lots of rapidly changing data, and let React sort out how to handle it in the virtual DOM.

1.  What does it mean to _think_ in react?
   I assume it means to develop with the mindset of understanding of how data will be flowing and design around that. If the components have all this additional functionality, you should design and develop with them in mind to make much more fluid interactive and powerful apps. 

2.  Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component.
    I Know we started out with function components. I really don't understand or know the differences between them. I know the class ones will use extend and super, but beyond that I'm totally lost. 

3.  Describe state.
    I think state is everything that's actually presented / exisiting in the app at a certain time. 
4.  Describe props.
    I think props is all the data that is passing to and from elements and components to dictate what the state will be.
